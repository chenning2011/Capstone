#outcome based on risk level 


#look at outcomes with risk level, ethnicity, race, lgbtq, marital status, religion, primary language, veteran


#also look at outcome with suicide/homicide risk, would be interesting to look at ctp data but that's weird
#maybe just length of stay and outcomes as well? highestgrade and outcomes? 
#program name and outcomes, age and outcomes

#look at ethnicity/race and risk level
